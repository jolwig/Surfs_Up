The purpose of this analysis was to help Avy determine if her ice cream and surf shop is sutainable year round. I helped her by finding temperature data from the months of June and December.

* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and in December the minimum is 56 degrees
* Standard deviation is greater in December (3.7 vs 3.3)
