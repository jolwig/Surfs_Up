# Surfs_Up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Avy determine if her ice cream and surf shop is sutainable year round. I helped her by finding temperature data from the months of June and December. 
## Results
* On average, it is warmer during June (74.4 degrees) than in December (71.0 degrees)
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and in December the minimum is 56 degrees
* Standard deviation is greater in December (3.7 vs 3.3)
## Summary                                                              
The weather is nice year round in Ohau! The temperature is mostly in the 70s however there were some colder days during December where it got down into the 50s. Ice cream sales could be down on those colder days, but overall the business seems sustainable year round based off of the temperature data. It could be useful to find the temperature data from January and February as well as December and count the total number of days where the temperature is in the 50s so that Avy can better prepare for days that are less busy.
